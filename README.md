# LiteHttp

A simple and easy-to-use package for OkHttp
Litehttp is a network request framework based on OkHttp that implements standard RESTful style network requests. The core advantage of Litehttp is that it provides a concise and easy-to-use interface, allowing developers to no longer focus on the details of network requests and thus focus more on their business logic. Litehttp supports custom callbacks, logging, caching of GET and POST, cookie saving, and provides a custom SSL authentication setting interface.
